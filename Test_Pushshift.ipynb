Then within 20 min started getting dozens of emails that the hacker was using my saved bank account to purchase thousands of dollars in BTC. They also converted a few hundred dollars in dust to BTC…and within 15 min….years and years of dedication towards crypto…..~~GONE~~ (edit: this may have been a little rash. 95% of my holdings were in ETH2, and apparently that has not been able to be withdrawn. At this point I've lost \\~$500 in alt dust. Additionally, the vast majority of my holdings are on a Ledger hidden up my ass.)\n",
