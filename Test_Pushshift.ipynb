      "\n",
      "I received a text message that my 2FA had been changed. Then within 20 min started getting dozens of emails that the hacker was using my saved bank account to purchase thousands of dollars in BTC. They also converted a few hundred dollars in dust to BTC…and within 15 min….years and years of dedication towards crypto…..~~GONE~~ (edit: this may have been a little rash. 95% of my holdings were in ETH2, and apparently that has not been able to be withdrawn. At this point I've lost \\~$500 in alt dust. Additionally, the vast majority of my holdings are on a Ledger hidden up my ass.)\n",

      "Update 1: I spoke with Coinbase - they credited the $2000 that was stolen from my bank account almost instantly. Of corse, my bank basically told me to get lost and good luck. I genuinely give Coinbase credit for how prompt they’ve been. They even refunded the $2k, prior to me finalizing the account access. So, I'll update once I have regained access to my account.\n",

      "Also, for those interested - I ran a full security scan of both my iphone and PC - neither of which seem have any threats detected. - looking as though the most likely explanation is a phishing breach (I'm embarrassed to even consider it), coupled with a data leak that I was involved in. \n",
